{"name":"Drought","tagline":"Just some barebones HTML/CSS to start each project. No single boilerplate or framework is perfect for all but here is what I've found works for me right now.","body":"# Drought - HTML & CSS Barebones\r\n\r\nDrought is what I use to start new projects. It starts with a basic two column layout, normalize.css and lots of great standards from [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com). It also includes a typical HTML structure and basic CSS that I tend to use and as of `v3.0` it includes LESS and now SASS. This has grown over the past several years from just a few snippets that I used often to what you see. I have adapted so many great things from other boilerplates and added what works for me. Feel free to take what you want from it or get inspired to create your own.\r\n\r\nGet started by doing a quick git clone, `git clone git@github.com:fleeting/Drought.git`. I'm constantly tweaking this project so if you are interested in that sort of stuff check out the `wip` branch, if there is one right now.\r\n\r\n**Created by James Fleeting**\r\n+ http://twitter.com/twofivethreetwo\r\n+ http://iwasasuperhero.com\r\n+ http://monkeecreate.com","google":"UA-1574394-40","note":"Don't delete this file!
